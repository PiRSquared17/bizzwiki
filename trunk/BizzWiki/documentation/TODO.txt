$Id$

== StubManager ==
* Use 'createStub2' method instead.

== PREVIEW ==
* Verify this interface does not impact security measures

== Job Queue ==
* Show Job Queue special page

== User ==
* Special:Import --> more granular right i.e. namespace level ??
* View User details: probably special page required for that
* "Delete User" extension
* User Log-in/out logs
* 'Block User' functionality: make sure the user is disallowed any 'edit' access

== SuperGroups ==
0) Configuration in BizzWikiSettings.php
1) TODO special page...
2) Internationalization...
3) Partitioning of NS_IMAGE namespace i.e. since the the problem is about files in the filesystem,
   it comes down to partitioning the filesystem space for this namespace
4) Delegation functionality: the capability for user X to delegate rights to user Y
5) User space partitioning: keep user groups separated under all circumstances
6) Table creation: integration with overall installation process
   Special page for sg table creation??

== Page History ==
* remove 'view logs for this page' link when user rights prohibits (PageHistory.php)

== MISC ==
* Internationalise!
* CHECK: 'UserSettingsChangedLog': log entries created outside of 'Special:Preferences' context ??
* 'notitle' magic word
* Job for the 'FileManager': reload from filesystem all file from installation.

== SpecialPagesManager ==
* Customized layout functionality

== Special:Undelete ==
* Fixme
* DOES NOT RESTORE PROTECTION (i.e. page level restrictions) when undeleting!!  (TBD)

== SpecialPagesManager ==
* Logging functionality?

== RecentChanges ==
* Enable enhanced view with Javascript by default

== Template ==
=== Links updating ===
* It would seem that 'parser cached' entries are not kept up-to-date when when templates are updated
** E.g. if page P1 uses T1 and T1 changes then cached P1 will not be updated until it is edited again.

== Stub Candidates ==
* SideBarEx        -> NO   (uses hSkinTemplateOutputPageBeforeExec)
* PageRestrictions -> NO   (uses ArticleViewHeader which is called VERY often)
* FileManager      -> NO

* TaskScheduler    -> TBD

== Rights Management ==
* Integrate 'ConfirmAccount' extension
* "Grant Right" functionality
** see Manual:$wgAddGroups
** see Manual:$wgRemoveGroups

== Replication functionality ==
* MW Special Page for managing the Replicator
* PHP scripts / Cron Jobs for Replicator
* SECURE way of gettings the 'user' table (ALL the fields !)
* Waiting for bug #10644 to be resolved
* Waiting for 'LogEvents' API to be fixed

== JOBS ==
* FetchPartnerUser table:   when an entry 'user creation log' appears in log?
* FetchPartnerPage
* FetchPartnerRevision

== Task Scheduler ==
* Special Page to manage tasks

== Article ==

== Logs ==
* Enhanced with Javascript: group similiar items

== Security ==
* HTTPS

== Presentation Layer ==
* Short URL
* JS form elements validation helper class
* JS file group packager
* List of templates used on a page.

== DynamicPageList2 ==
* TODO Integration 'DynamicPageList2' extension
** namespace level policing
** settings adjustments

== Things to watch out for ==
=== UserSettingsChangedLog ===
* Relies on a particular timing - skips the first call

=== API ===
* Log_Id field will be fixed when WikiMedia processes the field correctly -- won't need a patch anymore

== Security hole on password protected wikis ==
Hi, I just found out that even if you disable viewing pages for non logged in users one can still acess 
the uploaded media files when entering the direct URL. 
Is there a way to give only access to logged in users to download media files?
