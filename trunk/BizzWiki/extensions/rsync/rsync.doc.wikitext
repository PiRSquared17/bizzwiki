== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]

== Installation ==
To install independantly from BizzWiki:
* Download & Install [[Extension:StubManager]] extension
* Dowload all this extension's files and place in the desired directory
* Apply the following changes to 'LocalSettings.php' after the statements of [[Extension:StubManager]]:
<source lang=php>
require('extensions/rsync/Backup.php');
</source>
* If desired, an updated 'includes/Article.php' file can be installed. See [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Article.php patch]].

== Article.php patch ==
MediaWiki by default purges the 'recent changes' table for entries related to a delete article/image.
This behavior introduces some rather annoying side effects to this extension. A patched copy of Article.php
can be downloaded from BizzWiki's repository.
