$Id$

== PREVIEW ==
* Verify this interface does not impact security measures

== Job Queue ==
* Show Job Queue special page

== User ==
* Special:Import --> more granular right i.e. namespace level ??
* User Preferences change: add LOG entry 
* View User details: probably special page required for that
* "Delete User" extension
* User Log-in/out logs
* 'Block User' functionality: make sure the user is disallowed any 'edit' access

== SuperGroups ==
0) Configuration in BizzWikiSettings.php
1) TODO special page...
2) Internationalization...
3) Partitioning of NS_IMAGE namespace i.e. since the the problem is about files in the filesystem,
   it comes down to partitioning the filesystem space for this namespace
4) Delegation functionality: the capability for user X to delegate rights to user Y
5) User space partitioning: keep user groups separated under all circumstances
6) Table creation: integration with overall installation process
   Special page for sg table creation??

== Page History ==
* remove 'view logs for this page' link when user rights prohibits (PageHistory.php)

== MISC ==
* Internationalise!
* CHECK: 'UserSettingsChangedLog': log entries created outside of 'Special:Preferences' context ??
* 'notitle' magic word
* Job for the 'FileManager': reload from filesystem all file from installation.

== FileManager ==
* Reload from filesystem functionality (instead of deleting & reloading)

== SpecialPagesManager ==
* Customized layout functionality

== Special:Undelete ==
* Fixme
* DOES NOT RESTORE PROTECTION (i.e. page level restrictions) when undeleting!!  (TBD)

== SpecialPagesManager ==
* Logging functionality?

== RecentChanges ==
* Enable enhanced view with Javascript by default

== Template ==
=== Links updating ===
* It would seem that 'parser cached' entries are not kept up-to-date when when templates are updated
** E.g. if page P1 uses T1 and T1 changes then cached P1 will not be updated until it is edited again.

* SideBarEx        -> NO

* FormTools                -> YES
* PageAfterAndBefore       -> YES

** see Manual:$wgAddGroups
** see Manual:$wgRemoveGroups

* SECURE way of gettings the 'user' table (ALL the fields !)
* Waiting for bug #10644 to be resolved

* FetchPartnerPage
* FetchPartnerRevision
