== Purpose==
Defines a new hook 'backup' as a service to backup extensions.

== Features ==
* Page
** Creation   (done)
** Update     (done)
** Delete     (done)
** Move       
** Protection (done)
* File
** Upload     (done)
** Re-upload  (done) (same as upload)
** Delete
** Move       (not allowed - hence, nothing to implement)
* Log         (done)
* User
** Account creation
** Account options update

== Notes ==
=== Image ===
Upon deletion:
* no 'ArticleDelete' event is fired.
* recent changes table is cleared of any related entries
* log entry is created

== Theory Of Operation ==
Page change events are trapped and the corresponding 'Recent Change Identifier' (i.e. rc_id) field is attached
to a 'backup_operation' object. Trapping is done through the 'RecentChange_save' hook.
When a complete 'backup_operation' is ready, the event 'backup' is fired (i.e. the hook 'backup' is called).

== Dependancy ==
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension]]

== Installation ==
To install independantly from BizzWiki:
* Download & Install [[Extension:StubManager]] extension
* Dowload all this extension's files and place in the desired directory
* Apply the following changes to 'LocalSettings.php' after the statements of [[Extension:StubManager]]:
<source lang=php>
require('extensions/Backup/Backup.php');
</source>
* If desired, an updated 'includes/Article.php' file can be installed. See [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Article.php patch]].

== Article.php patch ==
MediaWiki by default purges the 'recent changes' table for entries related to a delete article/image.
This behavior introduces some rather annoying side effects to this extension. A patched copy of Article.php
can be downloaded from BizzWiki's repository.

== History ==

== See Also ==
This extension is part of the [[Extension:BizzWiki|BizzWiki Platform]].

== Todo ==
* Move: verify that we can safely grab the article_id from the title element or else
** Concurrency issue
* Delete: get ArticleId from the Logging event i.e. indirectly through the 'recent change' entry that is created
** The title object containing the article_id is kept all through the process
